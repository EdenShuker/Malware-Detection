# Malware Detection
This project main goal is to classify benign files and variants of malware files into their respective families. It consist of 2 parts, each one is a different approach to achieve this goal: one with XGBoost model and the second with deep learning model.

XGBoost Model:
Machine learning model using xgboost - a scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines.

Second model - Deep Learning:
Classification model based on convolutional network taken from 'Malware Detection by Eating a Whole EXE' paper written by Edward Raf, Jon Barker, Jared Sylvester, Robert Brandon, Bryan Catanzaro and Charles Nicholas (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09435.pdf).
